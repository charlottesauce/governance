# October 2019 Core Meeting Agenda

## Events (8:05pm)

 - No event recap this month, but Bonnie did meet with Josh and talk to him about how we could support his transition.  He still wanted to help us connect with event sponsors, so Bonnie has asked some DTLA people who have been maning the tables to work on a first draft for a [checklist for tabling HfLA events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12u6LHHp9MfgT521a9auijLGdk8iGo0Da3oGbEI7sIKg/edit ) once Josh has arranged them.  Josh will take the second pass.

## Discussion

- Sponsors overview, Community Partners application
- Fundraising upcoming. Earned revenue (LAFH) vs non-program funding.
- advisory board
- SOLA funds situation
- Winter happy hour 
  - Friday 12/13 or thursday 12/12 (but friday was prefered, several people had classes on Thurs).  
  - The vote was overwhelming for DTLA, but that is because there are more attendees at DTLA's hacknight.  At Santa monica, the vote was 16 to 11 Santa Monica.  
  - Several DTLAers pointed out it would take an hour to get to Santa Monica on the train at the end of the work day.

## FYI

- Bonnie's reimbursement - The current total due from HackerFund is now at $1,017.53 for both Summit and Congress. Bonnie is not full godzilla yet about it. But she did send Justin a slide deck after he misunderstood her expense report.
- Veronica came to our three hack nights when she was in town and it has led to a deeper relationship between our brigade and CFA.
- Nina, Wes and Bonnie had meeting with Veronica about more travel support for Brigade Congress and Summit, more infulence over who receives the support, etc.  We agreed to work on a new go forward plan together.  
  - Veronica will discuss internally, how much they are willing to increase their travel support (we are not the only large brigade that has asked).
  - Nina and the NAC are working on a doc for educating our membership about those events so that we can open the application process to help achieve the DEI goals of CfA.
  - Once the above is done, we will work on a local promotion plan.
